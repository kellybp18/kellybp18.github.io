I'm a seismologist and geophysicist who is passionate about mitigating the risk to human life and infrastructure damage due to natural hazards, particularly populations contending with frequent seismicity and potential for large magnitude earthquakes. My research focuses on rupture processes of major earthquakes, learning more about their behavior, and using those insights to improve seismic hazard assessment. I've written scripts to process seismic waveforms, perform inverse modeling, build and train ML models, and implement these codes in HPC environments to reach these research goals.
